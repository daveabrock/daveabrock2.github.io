The true power with ASP.NET Core is in its flexibility. With a powerful CLI, I can run an app on any platform with just a basic text editor, if I so desire. And speaking of desire: when I write code, I prefer [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's fast, responsive, and gives me exactly what I need and nothing more. Of course, I rely on Visual Studio 2017 from time-to-time for advanced debugging and profiling. But when I'm in a code-debug-code workflow, nothing is better.

Visual Studio Code is perfect for ASP.NET Core - allowing me to write front-end *and* back-end code in one great lightweight environment. Unfortunately, when I talk to ASP.NET Core developers many times Visual Studio Code isn't a consideration. Often, I hear that while Code is a great tool, it only is for those slinging front-end code. And after decades of the full-fledged Visual Studio being the only option to write .NET code, who can blame them?

Let's get started and walk through how you can debug C# code, query databases, and more with .NET Core using Visual Studio Code.

**Note**: All screenshots and keyboard shortcuts are using Windows 10, but they should be very similar on other operating systems like a Mac.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, you'll need to make sure you have the following installed on your platform of choice.

- [ASP.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/windows) (confirm installation by executing `dotnet --version` from a terminal window)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- After installing Code, the [OmniSharp C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)

Now that we have everything set up, let's start by creating a new ASP.NET Core web application from the [ASP.NET Core command-line interface (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/?tabs=netcore2x).

## Create a new Core project

We're going to create a new Core project first, using the ASP.NET Core CLI.

First, from a terminal window let's get a list of all available templates by adding the `-l` flag to our `dotnet new` command:

`dotnet new -l`

![Create a new Core project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/dotnet-new-l.PNG)

You can see that we can create a new project based on many different project template types. For our purposes, any application will do - let's go ahead and create a new ASP.NET Core MVC App by including the `Short Name` in the command in your terminal window.

`dotnet new mvc`

![MVC project options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/dotnet-new-mvc.PNG)

Now that we successfully created our project, we can open our new solution in Visual Studio Code. From the terminal, navigate one folder down to the project directory and enter `code .` from your terminal window.

## Working with your Core solution in Code

When you first open the C# project, you'll get a warning that Code needs to build required assets to the project.

![Build required assets dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/required-assets.PNG)

After you click `Yes`, you'll see a `.vscode` folder added to your project, which includes the following:

- `launch.json` - where Code keeps debugging configuration information
- `tasks.json` - where you can define any tasks that you need run - for example, `dotnet build` or `dotnet run`.

For example, here's what my `tasks.json` looks like out of the box.

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "build",
            "command": "dotnet build",
            "type": "shell",
            "group": "build",
            "presentation": {
                "reveal": "silent"
            },
            "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
        }
    ]
}
```

This allows me to build my solution without needing to keep entering `dotnet build` from the command line. In Windows, I can hit `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `B` much like I can in regular Visual Studio. Try it out!

## Debugging C# Code

Now, let's take a look at how C# debugging works in Visual Studio Code. First, set a breakpoint anywhere in the application much like you would do in any other IDE (in a gutter next to the line number). In my case, I'm creating a breakpoint inside the `About` controller action in `Controllers/HomeController.cs`.

![Create a breakpoint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/breakpoint.PNG)

Now, navigate to the **Debug** tab in Code and click the *Debug* button.

![Debug button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/debug-button.PNG)

Code will launch your application using `http://localhost:5000`.

![Launch site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/localhost.PNG)

Next, trigger your breakpoint - for me, that means clicking the `About` link in the top menu so that I can enter the `About` action in the `Home` controller.

If you go back to the Debug section in Code, you'll see all the debugging options at your disposal: accessing your variables, call stack, all your breakpoints, and even the ability to watch variables or objects.

![Debugging options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/debug.PNG)

Now, let's add a watch statement for the `ViewData` message.

![Watch statement - before](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/watch-before.png)

It's `null` now because I haven't executed that line of code yet. Once I step into the method, you'll see the value of `ViewData["Message"]`.
![Watch statement - after](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/watch-after.PNG)

Now that we've been able to debug C#, let's query a database!

## Working with Databases in Code

So, I've created a new C# project and can debug it in Visual Studio Code. Pretty cool, right? But with any server-side application, you'll want to work with a database. You can easily do this in Code - for our purposes, we'll be working with SQL Server.

(**Note**: If you are working with SQL Server on a Mac, a setup guide is beyond the scope of this post. This piece [should be able to assist you](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker).)

Before we get started, we'll need to install [Microsoft's own SQL Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql) from Visual Studio Code. Just search for `mssql` in the Extensions panel and you should have no problem finding it.

![mssql extension result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/mssql.PNG)

Now that you have the extension installed, you'll need to create a connection to your database server (this can be locally or even something hosted in Azure). To start connecting to the database, access the Command menu (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P`) and search for `sql`. You'll see all the commands the extension has provided for you.

![mssql command menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/command-menu.png)

Select `MS SQL : Connect` from the command menu and follow the prompts.

- **Server name** - since I am connecting locally, I just entered `(localhost)\MSSQLLocalDB.` You can do this, or if hosted in Azure the *mydb*.database.windows.net address, or even a remote IP address.
- **Database name** - enter the database you want to use (this is optional).
- **Integrated/SQL Server authentication** - pick your authentication method. If you're using a local DB, **Integrated** will do. For something like Azure, you'll need SQL authentication.
- **Profile name** - you can optionally enter a name for the profile.

Now that we're set up and connected, let's set up a database with horror movies. To do this, first create a *.sql* file in your project.

### Create sample database

In your SQL file, create a database. Feel free to copy and paste this syntax, then execute (`Ctrl` + `Shift` + `E`).

```sql
CREATE DATABASE MyHorrorDB
```

Now, if you execute the following you should be able to see the name of your new database.

```sql
SELECT Name FROM sys.Databases
```

Now that we have proof of our created databases, execute the following SQL to inject your database with sample data. You should notice IntelliSense-like completion!

```sql
USE MyHorrorDB
CREATE TABLE Movies (MovieId INT, Name NVARCHAR(255), Year INT)
INSERT INTO Movies VALUES (1, 'Halloween', 1978);
INSERT INTO Movies VALUES (2, 'Psycho', 1960);
INSERT INTO Movies VALUES (3, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 1974);
INSERT INTO Movies VALUES (4, 'The Exorcist', 1973);
INSERT INTO Movies VALUES (5, 'Night of the Living Dead', 1968);
GO
```

Now, do a blanket `SELECT` to get all your movies (obviously, a blanket `SELECT` is not recommended for performance reasons but this is pretty harmless since we're querying five movies).

```sql
SELECT * FROM Movies
```

Now you should your sample data in action!

![Query results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveabrock/blog-assets/master/blog/fullstackwithcode/horror-movies.PNG)

You can do much more than query databases, though! Take a look at [this document](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-develop-use-vscode) for more details.

## Wrapping up

While this is just scratching the surface, I hope this convinces you to give Visual Studio Code a try for developing in ASP.NET Core when you don't need a full-fledged IDE. And, of course, leave me a comment if you want to keep this conversation going!
