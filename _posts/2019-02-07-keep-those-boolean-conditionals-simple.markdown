When working on legacy projects (or even new ones!) you are bound to come across code that is interestingâ€”and trust me, your colleagues will say the same about your code from time to time!

There's always a balance between terseness and readability, and sometimes you can go overboard. Here's one I see sometimes that I don't particularly enjoy.

```csharp
// C# syntax
public bool CheckABoolean(int a)
{
    if (a > 42)
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}
```

Instead, do this. Your eyes and your colleagues will thank you.

```csharp
// C# syntax
public bool CheckABoolean(int a)
{
    return a > 42;
}
```
