Every Friday or so, I typically round up the week's best links. I wanted to expand on this further, and have a weekly digest of news and perspectives on the .NET world. I've always enjoyed the format of newsletters and have found many of them to be lacking. I think the community can do better.

I've launched a weekly newsletter called *The .NET Stacks*. It's a round up of the last week in .NET, but also delivered with perspective and analysis.

If you're interested, feel free to register below. I hope you enjoy it!
