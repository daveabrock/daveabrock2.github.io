subtitle: Let's look at the great streams from the .NET community.
---

I've been geeking out on a lot of Twitch streams lately. I think it's a fantastic way to learn and engage with other folks. I find I'll learn more by watching someone code in a natural environment and asking questions as you go. And with most streams getting archived, you can consume them as they fit your schedule.

I keep track of a few, but knowing I was missing some folks I sent out a tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I would like to start a thread to discover AWESOME .NET Twitch streams. I currently enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/LaylaCodesIt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LaylaCodesIt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dotnetdocsshow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dotnetdocsshow</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jguadagno?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jguadagno</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ljquintanilla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ljquintanilla</a>. But I *know* I&#39;m missing so much great community work.<br><br>Who else?!</p>&mdash; Dave Brock üíª ‚òÅÔ∏è (@daveabrock) <a href="https://twitter.com/daveabrock/status/1304792412678651906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As a result of my responses, I thought I'd keep a collection of awesome .NET streams for everyone to reference. If I left out your favorite stream, it wasn't intentional‚Äîplease [respond to the tweet](https://twitter.com/daveabrock/status/1304792412678651906) or leave a comment below to get added to the list. I just ask that you suggest streams that are somewhat active (every few months or so).
