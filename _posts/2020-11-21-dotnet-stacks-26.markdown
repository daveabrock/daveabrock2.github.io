# ü•≥.NET 5 has arrived

Well, we made it: .NET 5 is [officially here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0). This week, Microsoft showed off their hard work during three busy days of .NET Conf‚Äîand with it, some [swag](https://www.dotnetconf.net/swag) including my new [default Visual Studio Code theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dotnetconfteam.dotnet-purple-theme). I'm starting to wonder if overhyping Blazor is possible‚Äîas great as it is, I wish Microsoft would dial it back a bit.

Anyway: we've spent the better part of six months discussing all the updates (like, [my favorite things](https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/13/dotnet-stacks-25), [Blazor's readiness](https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/06/dotnet-stacks-24), [the support model](https://daveabrock.com/2020/10/31/dotnet-stacks-23), [what's happening to .NET Standard](https://daveabrock.com/2020/09/26/dotnet-stacks-18), [EF Core 5](https://daveabrock.com/2020/09/19/dotnet-stacks-17), [app trimming](https://daveabrock.com/2020/09/12/dotnet-stacks-16), [System.Text.Json vs. Newtonsoft](https://daveabrock.com/2020/08/08/dotnet-stacks-11), and so much more).

I know you‚Äôre here for the .NET Conf links‚Äîso let me be of service. You can see all the talks [from this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oVWop1HEOml2OdqbDs6IlcI), but the highlights are below.

# üíâ Dependency injection gets a community review

During the day job, I‚Äôve been teaching infrastructure engineers how to code in C#. With plenty of experience with scripting languages like PowerShell, explaining variables, functions, and loops isn‚Äôt really a big deal. Next week, however, I‚Äôll have to discuss dependency injection and I‚Äôm not looking forward to it. That‚Äôs not because they won‚Äôt understand it, because they‚Äôre very smart and they definitely will (eventually). It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a head-spinning topic to beginners but is essential to learn because ASP.NET Core is centered around it.

If you aren‚Äôt familiar with dependency injection, it‚Äôs a software design pattern that helps manage dependencies [towards abstractions and not lower-level implementation details](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/architectural-principles#dependency-inversion). [New is glue](https://ardalis.com/new-is-glue/), after all. In ASP.NET Core, we use interfaces (or base classes) to abstract dependencies away, and ‚Äúregister‚Äù dependencies in a service container (most commonly IServiceProvider in the ConfigureServices method in a project‚Äôs Startup class). This allows us to ‚Äúinject‚Äù services (or groups of services) only when we need them.

Right on cue, this week‚Äôs edition of .NET Twitter Drama included the [discussion](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1326271656776634368) of a [Hacker News article](https://t.co/Lq0KCy0jKZ?amp=1) criticizing the ASP.NET Core DI practice as overkill. The article mirrors a lot of HN: .NET rants with some valuable feedback nested inside.

In my experience, DI in general is a difficult concept to learn initially but sets you up for success for maintaining loose coupling and testability as your project matures. However, the initial ceremony can drive people away from ASP.NET Core as developers can view it as overkill if they think their project will never need it.

I do think the conversation this week helped folks understand that working with settings is very ceremonial and can lead to confusion (just look at the options pattern). This might foster .NET team discussions about doc updates and how to provide a better experience when working with configuration. A boy can dream, anyway.
